# ML Engineer Salaries Analysis

This project is a web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to analyze and visualize a dataset of ML Engineer salaries from 2020 to 2024. The application provides a table view of the data, a line graph to visualize the trend over the years, and a chat interface powered by the OpenAI API to get insights from the data.

## Features

- **Main Table**: A table displaying the year, number of total jobs, and average salary in USD. Users can sort the table by any column.
- **Line Graph**: A line graph that shows the trend of average salaries from 2020 to 2024.
- **Second Table**: When a row is clicked in the main table, a second table appears displaying the aggregated job titles and the number of jobs for that year.
- **Chat App**: A chat interface that allows users to ask questions and get insights from the dataset using the OpenAI API.
